# iOS_Predictive_Text_Table_View
Learning iOS, Xcode and Swift with an app a day (Day 5)

Inspired and guided by the tutorial at:

http://www.matthewhsingleton.com/coding-with-a-rubber-ducky/2016/5/26/predictive-text-table-view-swift-version-of-ray-wenderlich

This is a different app than I had planned to make, but here it is.

A custom predictive text for finding that pokemon name you forgot!

This tutorial, the one it updates from and following it are great examples of how fast swift and xcode change.

Even during the creation of this simple app xcode had many warnings and errors that needed fixed.

They all seem to be for the better, less complex names and better names and syntax. Super cool!

I did this one really quick so that's all I have to say for it, I'll come back and make it look pretty.

Then I'll leave a picture for you.
